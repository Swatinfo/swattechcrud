## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Installation

```bash
composer require swattech/crud
```

### Publish Configuration

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="SwatTech\Crud\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

### Generate CRUD for a Table

```bash
php artisan crud:generate users
```

See the installation guide for complete setup instructions.

## üìã Example Usage Scenarios

### Basic CRUD Generation

Generate complete CRUD operations for a table:

```bash
php artisan crud:generate products
```

This will create:
- Model with relationships
- Repository and Service layers
- Controller with RESTful methods
- Request validation classes
- Blade views with Vuexy theme
- API resources and controllers

### API-Only Generation

Generate RESTful API endpoints without UI components:

```bash
php artisan crud:api invoices
```

### Relationship-Focused Generation

Create CRUD with special focus on relationships:

```bash
php artisan crud:relationships products --belongs-to=categories --has-many=variants
```

### Generate Tests

Create comprehensive test suite:

```bash
php artisan crud:tests orders
```

## üîÑ Framework Integration

### Integration with Laravel's Authentication

The generated code works seamlessly with Laravel's built-in authentication:

```php
// Example of authorization in generated controllers
public function edit($id)
{
    $item = $this->service->findById($id);
    $this->authorize('update', $item);  // Uses Laravel Policy
    
    return view('items.edit', compact('item'));
}
```

### Event System Integration

The package dispatches Laravel events for all CRUD operations:

- `ModelCreated`
- `ModelUpdated`
- `ModelDeleted`

### Queue Integration

Long-running operations like imports/exports utilize Laravel's queue system automatically.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I customize the generated code?

You can publish the stubs and customize them:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="SwatTech\Crud\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="stubs"
```

Then edit the stub files in `resources/vendor/swattech/crud/stubs`.

### Does the package support custom relationships?

Yes, the package automatically detects relationships based on database structure but also allows manual configuration through the `--relationships` option.

### Can I use my own theme instead of Vuexy?

Yes. You can publish the view templates and customize them to match your theme. Set `theme.name` in the configuration to your custom theme name.

### Does this work with multi-database setups?

Yes, specify the database connection with `--connection=mysql2` when generating.

### How can I extend the generated controllers?

The best approach is to extend the generated classes. See extending documentation for examples.
